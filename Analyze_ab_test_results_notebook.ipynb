The probabilites of those who were in the control group and those in the treatment group were nearly the same, both being 12% when rounded to one decimal. Also 50% of individuals received the new page, which means that 50% received the old page. The individuals who received the old page were a tiny bit (one 12.0% vs. 11.8%) more likely to convert. So just looking at the numbers we would tend to say the old page converts a little bit better. But you should keep in mind that this could be due to the effect of Change Aversion. So you should test it with a bigger test group to see if this conclusion is supported or you should consider a hypothesis test with a Type I error rate of say 5%."

You could for example ask for the device each individual was using and whether this had an influence on the conversion or you could look at the page speed of the pages and see if this had an impact. There could be several different factors which could be interesting. When adding additional terms to my regression model, i have to consider that those terms should be independent, so that there is no correlation between those different terms. For example there might be a correlation between page speed and device which could distort my findings in the regression model. Plus, of course i need to have this data to take a look at it, i'm not sure if this data is existent."
